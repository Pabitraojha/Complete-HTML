<!--* *-->

<!--*1.How can you create a link within the same webpage that takes the user to a specific section
or element on the page? *-->
<!--ANSWER:::to create a link that takes the user to a specific section or element within the
same webpage, we can use the anchor(a) tag's href attribute along with the id attribute of
the target element using the # symbol-->

<!--*2.What is the difference between ralative and absolute URLs in the href attributes *-->
<!--ANSWER: Relative URLs are URLs that are relative to the current page's URL.
Absolute URLs are complete URLs, including the protect (http/https) and domain.
in relative url we write the complete url address but in case of the relative url 
we donot write the complete url-->

<!--*3.How does the download attribute work in the anchor tag. *-->
<!--ANSWER: The download attributes suggest that the linked resource should be downloaded instead of 
navigated to, prompting the user to download the file.-->

<!-- 4. When we use quotes, when not to???? and when we should use the single quote and when double quote-->
 <!--When we write a single attribute it ok to write it without a quote,
 but in case when use more than one attribute we have to write it inside the quote
 you can use either single quote or double quote but the mixer of both is not possible
 that means if you start with double quote then you must have to end with double quote
  instead of single quote..
  but you can use quote inside another quote like "hello'how are you'are you fine"-->
 <a href=https://www.google.com>favorite website</a><!--in this case if we are not writing the quote its ok-->

 <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The mozilla homepage">best website to learn html</a>
 <!--In this case there is more than one attributes thats why we have to write it inside the quotes-->
